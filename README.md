# Webshop
Competence project to my university classes


## Requirements
Just install this:
```bash
pip3 install psycopg2
```

## Virtual environment
You should use virtual environment every time you use application locally, so you don't have to care about installing Python packages:
```bash
source project/bin/activate
```

## Running server
After running server application will be available in your browser under this URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Structure of project:

* project - virtual environment

* webshop - place where our applications are installed

* shop - our main application
